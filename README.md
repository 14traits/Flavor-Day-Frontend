# front_end

Welcome to the FlavorDay Application Frontend, **Please note Culver's API is either being deprecated or is broken at this time**. While front end development might continue in another format later. It is doubtful I will spend much more time on the front end in it's current state. It might be refactored into Flutter since it's something I am familiar with to use as a learning environment. 

It is currently a VueJS app running a simple single page app with a MapBox custom marker and popup information. All data being populated is from my rails backend that is serving up the daily data. **Again the API I have reverse engineered is not correct at this time. While it does serve different daily data it's not correct as the stores will have a different flavor of the day.** 

If culvers ever fixes this api with solid data, that is verifiable working I will update and publish an actual app to a live site vs the planned I will spin the project to show it off only.
